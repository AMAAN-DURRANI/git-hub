    <h1>MAFIA</h1>
    <P class="text">"Mafia" is an informal term that is used to describe criminal organizations that bear a strong similarity to the
        Italian Mafia. The central activity of such an organization would be the arbitration of disputes between
        criminals as well as the organization and enforcement of illicit agreements between criminals through the use of
        or threat of violence.[1] Mafias often engage in secondary activities such as gambling, loan sharking,
        drug-trafficking, prostitution, and fraud.

        The term "mafia" was originally applied to the Sicilian Mafia. The term has since expanded to encompass other
        organizations of similar methods and purpose, e.g., "the Russian Mafia" or "the Japanese Mafia". The term was
        coined by the press and is informal; the criminal organizations themselves have their own names (e.g. the
        Sicilian Mafia and the related Italian-American Mafia refer to their organizations as "Cosa Nostra"; the
        "Japanese Mafia" calls itself "Ninky≈ç dantai" but is more commonly known as "Yakuza" by the public; "Russian
        Mafia" groups often call themselves "Bratva".)

        When used alone and without any qualifier, "Mafia" or "the Mafia" typically refers to either the Sicilian Mafia
        or the Italian-American Mafia and sometimes Italian organized crime in general (e.g., Camorra, 'Ndrangheta,
        etc.).</P>
